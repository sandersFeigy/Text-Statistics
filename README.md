        The Psychological Effects of Color
        Why is color such a powerful force in our lives? While
        perceptions of color are somewhat subjective, there are some color effects that have universal meaning.

        Colors in the red area of the color spectrum are known as warm colors and include red, orange, and yellow.
        These warm colors evoke emotions ranging from feelings of warmth and comfort to feelings of anger and hostility.

        Colors on the blue side of the spectrum are known as cool colors and include blue, purple, and green. These
        colors are often described as calm, but can also call to mind feelings of sadness or indifference.

        How do people respond to different colors? Select a color below to learn more about the possible effects and

        Color Psychology as Therapy
        Several ancient cultures, including the Egyptians and Chinese, practiced chromotherapy, or the use of colors to
        heal. Chromotherapy is sometimes referred to as light therapy or colorology.

        Colorology is still used today as a holistic or alternative treatment.  In this treatment:

        Red is used to stimulate the mind and to increase circulation.
        Yellow is thought to stimulate the nerves and purify the body.
        Orange is used to heal the lungs and to increase energy levels.
        Blue is believed to soothe illnesses and treat pain.
        Indigo shades are thought to alleviate skin problems.
        Modern Research on Color Psychology
        Most psychologists view color therapy with skepticism and point out that the supposed effects of color are often
        grossly exaggerated. Colors also have different meanings in different cultures.

        Research has demonstrated in many cases that the mood-altering effects of color may only be temporary. A blue
        room may initially cause feelings of calm, but the effect dissipates after a short period of time.
